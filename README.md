Theres lots of useful links included in the Victor Hugo Doc in the Documentation Folder,
I'll include a few more for ya'll.

***Step 1: Setting Up***

Install Brew: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)" `
(more info here: https://brew.sh)

Install NVM (Node Version Manager): `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash`
(check out their github for more info https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

Use NVM to install **Version 12** of Node.js: `nvm install 12`
(heres a decent article explaining what this is: https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-nvm)

Use Brew to install HUGO: `brew install hugo`
(as referenced here: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)

*you should all have git installed but just in case you don't follow the instructions at the link below

***Step 2: Setting up the Repo***

Use Terminal to complete the following steps, if you forgot the commands no worries I'll include them to the side.

- navigate to your desktop or wherever you what to put the project file: `cd desktop `
- make a new directory: `mkdir "myProjectFolder" ` (call it whatever you want, don't include the quotes)
- move into that directory: `cd "myProjectFolder" `
- now its time for git, clone this repo into your folder: `git clone "address-copied-from-above" `
(if you press the clone or download button on the top of this page you can see the address to copy)
- move into the folder you just cloned down: `cd mplsportfolioshow`
- we need to get all the dependencies for this project, use the following command: `npm install`
(Refer to this article for what npm is: https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/)
